    "# Project 2 - Veggie Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment you'll need to classify some images of vegetables. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "Please do two separate classifications:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> First, create a model from scratch. \n",
    "<li> Use transfer learning to use a pretrained model of your choice, adapted to this data. \n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "There won't be an explicit evaluation of accuracy, but you should take some steps to make each model as accurate as you reasonably can, any tuning option is fair game. Along with that, please structure it into a notebook that is well structured and clear that explains what you did and found. Think about:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Sections and headings. \n",
    "<li> A description of the approach taken (e.g. what did you do to determine size, tune, evaluate, etc...)\n",
    "<li> Visualization of some important things such as a confusion matrix and maybe some images. \n",
    "<li> Results, mainly focused on the scoring of the test data. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The descriptions and explainations should highlight the choices you made and why you made them. Figure up to about a page or so worth of text total, explain what happened but don't write an essay. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "Please sumbmit a link to your github, where everyhting is fully run with all the outputs showing on the page. As well, in the notebook please add some kind of switch controlled by a variable that will control if the notebook runs to train the model or to load the model in from weights - so I can download it and click run all, it will load the saved weights, and predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the start of this notebook will download and unzip the dataset, and there is also a simple example of creating datasets. You can change the dataset bit to use a different approach if you'd like. The data is already split into train, validation, and test sets. Please treat the separate test set as the final test set, and don't use it for any training or validation. Each folder name is its own label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Marking will be based on the following:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Models are cretaed, tuned, and effective at classifying the data: 40%\n",
    "<li> Descriptions and explanations of the approach taken: 20%\n",
    "<li> Code is well structured and clear: 20%\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the marking is pretty simple and direct, walk through the process of predicting the veggies, explain what you did, and show the results. If you do that, it'll get a good mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hints that may be helpful to keep in mind:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> The data is pretty large, so you'll want to use datasets rather than load everything into memory. The Keras docs have a few examples of different ways to load image data, our examples showed image generators and the image from directory datasets.  \n",
    "<li> Be careful of batch size, you may hit the colab limits. \n",
    "<li> You'll want to use checkpoints so you can let it train and pick up where you left off.\n",
    "<li> When developing, using a smaller dataset sample is a good idea. These weights could also be saved and loaded to jump start training on the full data. \n",
    "<li>"

    "The download_and_unzip_data function downloads a zip file containing the vegetable image dataset from a specified URL. If the file doesn't exist locally, it's downloaded and unzipped. This step ensures that we have access to the dataset for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generate_datasets function prepares the training and validation datasets using TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator. This generator provides a way to load images from a directory, preprocess them, and generate batches of data for training and validation. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, zooming, and flipping are applied to the training dataset to increase its diversity and improve the model's robustness. The images are resized to a common size (224x224 pixels) and normalized to have pixel values in the range [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Definition:\n",
    "The define_model function constructs a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using the Sequential API from Keras. This model consists of three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the input images. The extracted features are then flattened and passed through two densely connected layers, culminating in a softmax layer for multi-class classification. The choice of activation function (ReLU for hidden layers and softmax for the output layer) and model architecture are common practices in image classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training:\n",
    "The train_model function compiles and trains the defined model using the training and validation datasets. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, which is an efficient optimizer for gradient-based optimization. The categorical cross-entropy loss function is chosen since it's suitable for multi-class classification tasks. During training, the model's performance metrics (accuracy and loss) are monitored on both the training and validation datasets over multiple epochs. The training loop iterates through the specified number of epochs, adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the loss and improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Evaluation:\n",
    "After training, the evaluate_model function evaluates the trained model's performance on the validation dataset. This step helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data. The evaluation results, including validation loss and accuracy, provide insights into the model's performance and its ability to correctly classify vegetable images into their respective categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization of Training History:\n",
    "Finally, the plot_training_history function visualizes the training history using matplotlib. Two plots are generated: one showing the training and validation accuracy over epochs, and the other showing the training and validation loss over epochs. These plots help monitor the model's training progress, identify any overfitting or underfitting issues, and make informed decisions about model tuning and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the code demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, training, evaluating, and visualizing a deep learning model for vegetable image classification. It follows best practices in deep learning, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and visualization, to achieve accurate and reliable classification results.\n"
